# DecodeCpp 🚀

Welcome to **DecodeCpp**, a structured repository of C++ programs I’ve written while mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
Each folder represents a lecture/topic and contains code snippets, practice problems, and key concepts from my DSA learning journey.

---

## 📁 Folder Organization

The repository is organized in a clear lecture-wise manner:

- `lecture1` to `lecture20` – Basics, patterns, loops, arrays, strings, pointers
- `lecture21` to `lecture40` – Sorting, recursion, prefix sum, sliding window
- `lecture41` to `lecture60` – Linked lists, stacks, queues, binary trees, BST
- `lecture61` to `lecture75` – DP (Dynamic Programming), Bit Manipulation
- `lecture76` to `lecture82` – Graphs (BFS, DFS, topological sort)
- `lecture90+` – Backtracking, Tries, Bit Manipulation advanced

📝 **Note:** Some folders like `incomplete`, `unsolved`, or `recursion prereq` are included for revision and self-tracking.
